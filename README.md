# Bigint
## Overview
The BigInteger library provides functions for arithmetic operations on large integers that cannot be represented using built-in data types. This library is useful for applications that require working with extremely large numbers, such as cryptography, data processing, and numerical analysis.
## Features
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Modulus
## Usage
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
* Include the header file biginteger.h in your project.
* Link the library object file libbiginteger.a to your executable.
* Use the provided functions in your code to perform arithmetic operations on large integers.
